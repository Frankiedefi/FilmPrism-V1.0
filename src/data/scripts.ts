INT. ANCIENT TEMPLE - DAY

SARAH JONES, 30s, adventurous archaeologist, carefully steps into a dimly lit chamber. Dust particles dance in the thin beams of light filtering through cracks in the ceiling.

SARAH
(whispering)
This is it. The lost temple of Azura.

She pulls out a small notebook, scribbling furiously.

SARAH (CONT'D)
After all these years...

Suddenly, a low rumble echoes through the chamber. Sarah freezes.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Oh, no.

The floor begins to shake. Sarah sprints towards the entrance, dodging falling debris.

EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah bursts out of the temple entrance, gasping for air. Behind her, the ancient structure collapses in on itself.

SARAH
(catching her breath)
Well, that was close.

She looks down at her notebook, a smile spreading across her face.

SARAH (CONT'D)
But worth it.

FADE OUT.

INT. DETECTIVE MIKE STONE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

DETECTIVE MIKE STONE, 40s, rugged and world-weary, sits at his cluttered desk, illuminated by a single lamp. Empty coffee cups and case files litter the surface.

A phone RINGS. Mike answers.

MIKE
Stone.

CAPTAIN HARRIS (V.O.)
(filtered)
Mike, we've got another one. Down by the docks.

Mike sighs, rubbing his temples.

MIKE
I'll be there in twenty.

EXT. CITY DOCKS - NIGHT

Mike's car pulls up to a crime scene buzzing with activity. Police lights flash, casting eerie blue and red glows on the wet pavement.

DETECTIVE SARAH CHEN, 30s, sharp and determined, approaches Mike as he exits his car.

SARAH
Glad you could join us, Stone.

MIKE
What have we got?

Sarah leads Mike towards a covered body near the water's edge.

SARAH
Male, mid-thirties. Same M.O. as the others.

Mike kneels down, lifting the sheet slightly. His face hardens.

MIKE
The Dockside Killer strikes again.

Sarah nods grimly.

SARAH
We need to catch this bastard, Mike. Before anyone else dies.

Mike stands, his eyes scanning the dark waters of the harbor.

MIKE
We will, Sarah. Whatever it takes.

FADE OUT.
